1. **Download the Repository**: Begin by downloading the repository to your local machine. You can do this by clicking the "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP."

2. **Unzip the Directory**: Once the download is complete, unzip the downloaded file to reveal the repository directory.

3. **Run the Installation Script**: Locate and double-click the "install.bat" file within the unzipped directory. This script automates the installation process, ensuring that Python and other necessary components are installed seamlessly.

If the script above fails to work, Python can be downloaded from [here]("https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.2/python-3.10.2-amd64.exe").

4. **Execute the Desired File**: Double-click on the file to run the desired program.
